Tonight, he must attend the opening of his latest movie \"Head On,\" but first he and his three best friends from back home (Queens, NY) have lunch and discuss their upcoming 10-year high school reunion. Vince is reluctant to go but his buddies urge him to go with them. At the post-premiere party, Vince's agent, Ari, hassles Eric about getting Vince to read the script for a possible new project. Over breakfast, Vince says he's not going to do \"Matterhorn\" on Eric's advice. The foursome goes to meet with the director where Vince impresses him so much that Ari calls later to tell him that they've offered $4 million for the part. While Turtle and Drama celebrate, Vince lets him know that Eric is not too enthused about the script. Later, Ari and Eric share a rather confrontational dinner while discussing the future of their star's career. After Vince decides to take Eric's advice not to do the movie, the boys leave for their reunion. Before they can drive off, though, they get a call with some bad news: Colin Farrell has taken the part.</p>",

While Turtle and Drama talk up Luke Wilson about his new home theater system, Jimmy Kimmel invites Vince to come on his show to promote \"Head On.\" In the morning, the foursome discuss their past relationships with women, and the consensus (all but Eric) seems to be that it's better to leave a girl dangling than break up with her. Drama also fills Vince in on his old grudge against Jimmy Kimmel. Later on, Eric tries his best to do a pre-interview for Vince's appearance while they all enjoy a game of golf. Afterwards, he breaks it to Vince that one of his one-night stands will be appearing on the show as well. The day of the show, Kristen stops by the guest house to pick up some things from Eric where the visit quickly turns into \"break-up sex.\" Meanwhile, Drama and Turtle visit Rufus, who tells them that if Vince plugs his company on the show, they'll get their home theater system for free. At the show, the boys go to the Green Room while Vince finds sets out for a pre-show apology/visit. Emily shows up and shares a cigarette with Eric, and with a little help from Drama, their free home theater system is secured.</p>",

The entire entourage attends a party at Rubenstein's Santa Barbara mansion, but all of the goodwill that Vince earns is destroyed when a prized model of Shrek disappears from the producer's house during the party. Suspicion immediately turns to Dom, but the ex-con flatly denies the theft.
